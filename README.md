About 
-----

This project provides a robotic surgical visualization environment. It supports loading 3D meshes
and pose data (such as provided by a da Vinci robot), rendering the meshes in 2D and 3D viewports.
It also supports live editing of the estimated pose of the 3D models to allow calibration offsets from the tracking method to be calibrated out.
